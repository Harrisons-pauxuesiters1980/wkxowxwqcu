I just walked out of the theater after watching Riff-Raff and, man, am I feeling all sorts of things right now. First off, let’s clear the air: it's not what they call a big, inspiring movie. It’s like being invited to a party where everyone’s skint and wearing the same muddy boots, and you can smell the overboiled cabbage from the kitchen. Not glamorous, but it’s the kinda party where you might hear some truths you weren’t ready for.

The whole movie feels like it’s shot through a foggy London morning after a night out, you know? There's something raw and dirty, like a clogged toilet you just can't fix, no matter how many times you snake the damn thing. These characters, all scraping by, just... existing between demolished buildings and half-finished dreams. It reminded me of when I had to deal with that busted pipe in my flat last winter. Cold, bleak, and nobody really wants to deal with the mess, but you gotta.

I don’t know, the main guy, Stevie, he’s got this look like he’s always five bucks short of a good day. You feel for him, you do, but at the same time you wanna shake him by the shoulders and shout Get it together, mate! Yet, aren't we all a bit like Stevie? Messed up, stumbling in bad shoes, pretending we know the way to the next payday.

> Then there's that scene where Stevie and his pals end up in this random flat, painted yellow like some hallucination of warmth. Are they even happy there? Hell if I know, but they're trying, which counts for something, right? Maybe it's like trying to fix a leaky faucet with hope and a bit of cheap epoxy—you know it'll probably fail, but it's all you've got.

And that soundtrack, Jesus. It’s the kind of noise that makes you feel like you're perpetually in a broken elevator going nowhere. It's all a bit too real, if I’m honest. By the end, I was thinking, Why are you doing this to yourself? But then, I realized, it’s like listening to your parents bicker—uncomfortable, awkward, and you can't tune it out.

Let’s be real, this isn’t exactly Saturday night fun, and it’s more of an ‘I’m gonna download that movie and watch it on a Wednesday when I’m feeling too existential’ kinda deal. It’s not for everyone. It’s not even comforting. It’s like putting on your old work boots and finding a hole but wearing them anyway because, screw it, they’re yours.

```javascript
function followStevie(dream) {
  if (dream === 'demolished') {
    return reality;
  } else {
    return struggle;
  }
}
```

Anyway, if you’re up for seeing life stripped down of all its Instagram filters, give it a watch. Riff-Raff doesn’t leave you with much hope, but maybe it’s waiting for you to find some on your own. Or not. It's a bit like trying to unclog a drain—messy, frustrating, but kinda satisfying when you finally clear it.
